# Env Contract

The environment contract is code-owned by `src/unilab/base/base.py` and
`src/unilab/base/torch_env.py`. Observation semantics are recorded in
{doc}`/adr/ADR-0005-unified-obs-critic-env-and-ipc-contract` and superseded by
{doc}`/adr/ADR-0011-torch-only-manager-based-runtime`.

## Required Shape

- `TorchEnvState.obs` is `dict[str, torch.Tensor]`. It is not a flat tensor.
- The required actor observation key is `obs`.
- The only optional critic-only observation key is `critic`.
- `obs_groups_spec` maps each observation group name to its flat dimension.
  Wrappers and learners use this map to size actor and critic paths.
- `reset(env_indices)` accepts a one-dimensional Torch integer tensor (or
  `None`) and returns `(obs_dict, info_dict)` for the reset rows.
- `step(actions)` on `TorchEnv` accepts a contiguous float32 Torch tensor and
  returns `TorchEnvState`; external adapters may transfer tensors to a trainer
  device only at the adapter boundary.
- There is no legacy environment fallback. Unsupported devices, carriers, and
  backend tensor lifecycles fail closed.

## Owner Responsibilities

- Env code owns MDP semantics, observation construction, rewards, termination,
  truncation, reset behavior, and final-observation handling.
- Runners and learners must not invent critic observations by concatenating
  fields outside the env owner layer.
- If a third-party library still calls critic observations "privileged", keep
  that name translation inside the adapter. Inside UniLab, the key is `critic`.
