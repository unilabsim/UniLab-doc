# Support Matrix

Each generated block is assembled from registry entries, owner-YAML backend
identity, validation inventories, and UniSim's static platform profiles. The
generator implementation is `scripts/tools/support_matrix.py`. Do not infer
support beyond the evidence grade shown below.

## Backend Selection Rules

- The tensor-only Manager runtime currently supports `mujoco`, `mjwarp`,
  `genesis`, `newton`, `motrix`, and the scoped Drake owner below.
- The default backend is `mujoco`.
- `--sim mjwarp` requires the `mjwarp` extra. Validated combinations are shown
  in the generated matrix below; all other entrypoints retain their matrix
  evidence grade.
- `--sim genesis` requires the `genesis` extra; real CUDA/platform requirements
  are shown in the generated matrix.
- `--sim newton` requires the `newton` extra; real CUDA/platform requirements
  are shown in the generated matrix.
- `--sim motrix` requires the `motrix` extra; the CPU-authoritative packed
  HOST_BRIDGE profile is shown in the generated matrix.
- `--sim drake` requires the local Drake extra and DrakeUni batch extension.
  Its current scoped support claim is PPO `go2_joystick_flat` only.
- `--algo`, `--task`, and `--sim` jointly select the owner YAML.
- Do not treat `training.sim_backend` as a standalone backend switch.
- `isaacgym`, `isaacsim`, and `superdex` are temporarily outside this runtime
  scope. Their adapters remain in UniSim, but they are not UniLab production
  support claims; re-enabling requires capability, parity, and support-matrix
  evidence (#1811).

## Playback Differences

- `mujoco`: `--render-mode auto` exports `play_video.mp4`; `--render-mode
  viser` serves the rollout in a browser-based viser viewer.
- `mjwarp`: supports explicit, finite-step `record` by default, rendered offline
  through the task owner's MuJoCo visual model; `--render-mode interactive`
  routes to the MuJoCo interactive viewer (mjwarp runs the physics while
  MuJoCo renders env[0], forced to a single env); `--render-mode viser`
  routes to the browser-based viser viewer with per-env MuJoCo playback
  models; `auto` and native renderers are not supported.
- `genesis`: `viser` is unsupported, as is the MuJoCo interactive/offline
  playback contract described here.
- `newton`: the canonical owners use `record` through native Newton rendering,
  with the MuJoCo snapshot as the incomplete-install fallback.
- `--render-mode record`: MuJoCo and mjwarp record a video only.
- `--render-mode none`: no playback.

### Evidence Grades

| Grade | Repository evidence |
|---|---|
| `Registered` | The env/backend exists in `registry.list_registered_envs()` after `ensure_registries()`. |
| `Configured` | The owner YAML sets `training.sim_backend` to the backend. |
| `Tested` | Automated coverage or explicit maintainer validation; it is not a default recommendation. |
| `Benchmarked` | A checked-in benchmark manifest is bound to the combination. |
| `Recommended` | Explicit recommendation metadata exists in the repository. |

`Tested` describes repository evidence only; it does not imply every DR, rendering, or production capability of the MuJoCo owner. No benchmark or recommendation metadata is currently checked in, so rows do not auto-promote to `Benchmarked` or `Recommended`.

### Tensor Backend Platform Matrix

This table is derived from UniSim's SDK-free public static inventory. It describes reviewed tensor-lifecycle boundaries, not optional-SDK installation and not automatic task-owner support.

## Platform Troubleshooting

CUDA-only tensor backends are rejected before backend construction on CPU, MPS,
macOS, ROCm/HIP, unavailable CUDA, malformed CUDA ordinals, and out-of-range
device requests. They do not fall back to NumPy or a host bridge.

Check the Torch runtime and visible ordinals in the same process environment:

```bash
uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda, torch.version.hip, torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.device_count(), torch.cuda.current_device())"
```

`torch.version.hip` must be `None` for the CUDA-only matrix. If CUDA is
unavailable, check the NVIDIA driver/container mismatch before changing task
configuration. If `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set, backend ordinals address that
remapped namespace, not host-global physical indices.

On macOS and ROCm, use a CPU-authoritative host-bridge backend. On ROCm,
Manager/TorchEnv uses the current GPU only when the training process explicitly
requests that learner device and the backend accepts the routed `cuda`
`manager_torch_device`; direct environment construction remains CPU. GPU Torch
buffers on a host bridge do not imply GPU physics or a device-resident backend
lifecycle.
